Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a poor woodcutter with his wife and two children, Hansel and Gretel. They were so poor that the woodcutter couldn't provide enough food for his family. One day, their stepmother decided to take the children deep into the forest and leave them there because they couldn't afford to feed them.

Hansel overheard their plan and decided to leave a trail of breadcrumbs so they could find their way back home. However, the birds ate the breadcrumbs, and the children were lost in the forest. After walking for hours, they stumbled upon a cottage made of candy, cookies, and cake.

Without hesitation, they started eating the sweets, but the cottage's owner, an old witch, appeared and captured them. She locked Hansel in a cage and made Gretel her servant. She planned to eat Hansel when he became plump enough.

However, Hansel had a plan. He collected a bone from his dinner every night and gave it to the witch to feel his finger to see if he was fattening up. One day, Hansel gave the witch a chicken bone instead, and the witch, who was nearly blind, was fooled.

Gretel had been secretly plotting a way to rescue her brother, and with Hansel's help, they pushed the witch into her own oven, where she was burnt to a crisp.

Hansel and Gretel found their way back home, and their father was overjoyed to see them. They lived happily ever after, and the stepmother never dared to mistreat them again.
