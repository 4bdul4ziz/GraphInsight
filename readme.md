# GraphInsight: A Graph-based Approach to Summarize multi media content

The project is a Python-based tool that uses various natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision techniques to extract and summarize textual content from various sources such as images, PDFs, and websites. It makes use of several libraries such as NLTK, docx, bs4, cv2, pytesseract, and tika to preprocess the input data and generate a concise and relevant summary.
